### Algorithms and Features in pm4py Not Available in pm4js

## Process Discovery Algorithms:

> Inductive Miner: An advanced algorithm for discovering process models from event logs. It's more robust and handles noise better than some other algorithms.

> Heuristics Miner: Used to discover process models based on frequency and dependency relations between activities.

> Alpha++ Miner: An extension of the Alpha Miner, designed to handle certain limitations and provide more accurate models.

> Hybrid-based Miner: Combines the strengths of different mining techniques to produce better models.

## Conformance Checking:

> Token-based Replay: Measures the conformance of event logs against a process model by replaying the events on the model.

> Alignments: Provides a detailed analysis of deviations between the event log and the process model.

## Process Enhancement:

> Bottleneck Analysis: Identifies parts of the process that cause delays.

> Performance Analysis: Enhances discovered models with performance metrics, such as throughput times.

### Data Mining and Machine Learning:

> Predictive Process Monitoring: Uses machine learning techniques to predict future states of ongoing cases.

> Clustering and Classification: Various algorithms to group similar cases or classify them based on certain criteria.

## Visualization Tools:

> Petri Nets: Advanced visualization of process models using Petri nets.

> Dotted Chart Analysis: Visual representation of event occurrences over time.

## General Tools:

> Event Log Filtering: Advanced filtering options to preprocess event logs.

> Data Conversion Tools: Extensive support for converting between different process mining data formats (e.g., XES, CSV, BPMN).
